This tool has 2 components:
netID_extractor: This script cleans the data and outputs a csv file with the desired specifications.

analysis_package: This script analyzes the data file given and produces pie charts based using the matplotlib library


Ideas:
- Make a UI/terminal app for data cleaning (netID_extractor) and web automation to retrieve user data (use ldap API)
